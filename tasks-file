1. Log Analysis & Monitoring
Use case: Identify failures, trends, and anomalies
Typical tasks:
Count error types in logs
Extract last N errors
Rotate and archive logs
Generate daily error reports

Example:
grep -i error application.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr


2. Disk, Memory & CPU Monitoring
Use case: Prevent outages due to resource exhaustion
Typical tasks:
Alert if disk usage > 80%
Capture memory and CPU usage
Send email / Slack alerts

Example:
df -h | awk '$5+0 > 80 {print $0}'


3. Backup & Restore Automation
Use case: Data protection and disaster recovery
Typical tasks:
Take daily backups of databases/files
Compress and upload to S3
Auto-delete backups older than N days

Example:
tar -czf backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz /data

4. Application Deployment Scripts
Use case: Consistent and repeatable deployments
Typical tasks:
Pull latest code
Build artifacts
Restart services
Rollback on failure

Example:
git pull && systemctl restart app.service

5. Service Health Checks
Use case: Ensure critical services are running
Typical tasks:
Check status of nginx, docker, kubelet
Auto-restart failed services
Log downtime

Example:
systemctl is-active nginx || systemctl restart nginx

6. User & Permission Management
Use case: Server access control
Typical tasks:
Create/delete users
Set SSH access

Enforce least privilege

Example:

useradd devuser && passwd devuser

7. Cleanup & Cost Optimization

Use case: Reduce storage and cloud costs

Typical tasks:

Delete old logs

Remove unused Docker images

Clean temp directories

Example:

find /var/log -type f -mtime +30 -delete

8. CI/CD Pipeline Helpers

Use case: Support Jenkins / GitHub Actions

Typical tasks:

Version tagging

Artifact naming

Build metadata generation

Example:

BUILD_ID=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)

9. Kubernetes Automation

Use case: Cluster operations

Typical tasks:

Check pod health

Restart failed pods

Capture namespace resource usage

Example:

kubectl get pods -A | grep CrashLoopBackOff

10. Cloud Resource Reporting (AWS/Azure/GCP)

Use case: Visibility and governance

Typical tasks:

List running EC2 instances

Identify unused volumes

Generate cost reports

Example:

aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId'

11. Security & Compliance Checks

Use case: Reduce attack surface

Typical tasks:

Find open ports

Detect failed SSH attempts

Validate file permissions

Example:

grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log

12. Cron Job Automation

Use case: Scheduled maintenance

Typical tasks:

Daily health checks

Log cleanup

Backup execution

Example:

0 2 * * * /opt/scripts/backup.sh
