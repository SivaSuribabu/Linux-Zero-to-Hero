This line is a cron job entry. It tells Linux when and how to run your script automatically.
0 23 * * * /bin/bash /opt/scripts/daily_error_report.sh

Cron Time Fields (Left Side)

Cron format:
┌ minute (0–59)
│ ┌ hour (0–23)
│ │ ┌ day of month (1–31)
│ │ │ ┌ month (1–12)
│ │ │ │ ┌ day of week (0–7, Sun=0 or 7)
│ │ │ │ │
0  23  *  *  *

Meaning of each value
0 → minute 0 (exactly at the start of the hour)
23 → hour 23 (11:00 PM)
* → every day of the month
* → every month
* → every day of the week
👉 So this runs every day at 11:00 PM

Command Part (Right Side)
/bin/bash /opt/scripts/daily_error_report.sh

Explanation

/bin/bash → explicitly uses the Bash shell

/opt/scripts/daily_error_report.sh → full path to your script

Why full paths are important in cron

Cron runs with a minimal environment

Relative paths may fail

Explicit shell + absolute paths = production best practice

What Happens at 11:00 PM Daily

Cron wakes up

Bash is invoked

daily_error_report.sh runs

Log analysis is performed

A new date-based error report is generated

How to verify it is working
Check cron logs
grep CRON /var/log/syslog      # Ubuntu/Debian
grep CRON /var/log/cron       # RHEL/CentOS

Test manually
/bin/bash /opt/scripts/daily_error_report.sh

Common production mistakes (avoid these)
Mistake	Result
Using sh instead of bash	Script may fail
Using relative paths	Cron cannot find files
Missing execute permission	Script won’t run
Fix permission
chmod +x /opt/scripts/daily_error_report.sh
